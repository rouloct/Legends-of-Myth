This is the updated version of _Creatures of Myth_ and is currently in-progress. The name change to _Legends of Myth_ reflects a change in focus from creatures to well known characters, such as Zeus and Loki. The game retains many elements of the previous version, but with actions being performed by playing cards and an additional mechanic called _Boosting_ to add additional variety and strategy to each card.
